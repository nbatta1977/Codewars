Codewars Unique in Order Kata Solution:

def unique_in_order(iterable):
    # Account for an empty array:
    if len(iterable) == 0:
        return []
    
    # Set up needed variables for looping below:
    length = len(iterable)
    newLst = []
    newLst.append(iterable[0])
    # Set starting letter to equal the first element in the passed in array:
    letter = iterable[0]
    
    # Loop through array arguement and check against letter.
    # If it equals the letter, set letter to new value and do nothing:
    for let in iterable:
        if let == letter:
            letter = let
            continue
            
    # Loop through the array arguement and check against letter.
    # If it doesn't equal the letter, append the value to the new list
    # And set letter to new value
        if let != iterable:
            newLst.append(let)
            letter = let
    # Return the completed new list. 
    return newLst
